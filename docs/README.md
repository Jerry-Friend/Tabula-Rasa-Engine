## **Project overview** 

Tabula Rasa Engine is a 3D game engine developed/coded from scratch with OpenGL in C++. The engine contains all the basic [sub-systems](https://wilhelman.github.io/Tabula-Rasa-Engine/#main-core-subsystems) of a modern 3D engine and we have also added support to handle [skeletal animations](https://wilhelman.github.io/Tabula-Rasa-Engine/#skeletal-animation-subsystem). Although this project has been done with educational purposes it will be used (along other engines from our class) to produce a game in the Project 3 subject in the first half of 2019. 

This project has been done by two students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain) for the subject Game Engines.
