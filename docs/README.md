## **Project overview** 

Tabula Rasa Engine is a 3D game engine developed/coded from scratch with OpenGL in C++.

The engine contains all the basic [sub-systems](https://wilhelman.github.io/Tabula-Rasa-Engine/#main-core-subsystems) of a modern 3D engine and we have also added support to handle [skeletal animations](https://wilhelman.github.io/Tabula-Rasa-Engine/#skeletal-animation-subsystem). Although this project has been done with educational purposes it will be used (along other engines from our class) to produce a game in the Project 3 subject in the first half of 2019.

This project has been done by two students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain) for the subject Game Engines.

## **Main core subsystems**

Our game engine code is structured in modules. The main module (called trApp.cpp) manages all the other modules calling in a loop its respective awake, preupdate, update, postupdte, cleanup that they share thorugh a base class trModule. Down below a basic scheme of this structure (only some example modules are showed here):

![dibujo sin titulo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25589509/50381846-84d3ac00-0691-11e9-8390-3f2fc765b614.png)

On the following sections we will explain the main core sub-systems of this engine.


### 3D Renderer

Our engine has a module renderer that handles all the drawing of the proram. We don't use shaders. Instead we use OpenGL Vertex Arrays with indices (except for the debug draw of the primitives which are rendered in direct mode). Everything is drawn in the post update of the module. There, the gameobjects are filtered and we only render the ones that are inside the fustrum. 

### Geometry loader

When we detect a file in our Assets/Models/ directory we read the file with Assimp and extract all the information we need (vertices, indices, uvs, name...) in order to render the mesh on screen. Then we save the resource in our own binary format.

Each time a resource mesh is generated a scene is generated in our own binary format too.

### Textures



### Gameobject structure

...

### Binary files format

All assets in Assets/ are saved as resources in our own binary format inside the Library directory. Doing this we only save the data we need and when we have to read the process is easier and much faster than if we had to read the original asset file such as .fbx or .png. A new resource in our own binary format is generated each time we detect a new assets in Assets/.

All the assets generate a resource in our own binary format except the textures which will be saved as DDS files for speed and standard convention reasons.

Our engine accepts the following assets formats:
* Meshes: FBX and Collada (.dae).
* Texture: png, jpg, jpeg, dds and tga.
* Animations: Collada (.dae)


### 3D Camera & frustum culling

Our engine has two cameras: the editor camera (which can be controlled as in any other 3D software) and the game camera. The game camera is treated as a component of the gameobject 'Main Camera' and has frusutm culling using a quadtree so gameobjects outisde its frustum won't be drawn. 

### Quadtree

We've implement a quadtree container in our engine to speed things up. All the gameobjects in the scene that are marked as static in the inspector are inserted inside the quadtree. The quadtree will subdivide itself in four as many times as it needs to redistribute the gameobjects and match the specified bucket size. Doing this we can safely discard gameobjects whose quadtree node does not intersect with the camera frustum speeding up the frustum culling process.

### Data serialization

Our engine serializes the entire hierarchy of objects scene through all the gameobjects and their corresponding components. For this we use UUIDs (Universally unique identifier) to be able to handle all the information when serializing and deserializing a scene. For our engine the UUIDs are generated by random numbers of 32 bits.

### Mouse picking

Mouse picking is done using the Raycast method. When the left mouse button is clicked, the camera module calculates a ray that will start in the corresponding clicked point in the near plane and will project until it reaches the far plane. Once we have that we just need to do:

- Collect all the gameobjects (both dynamic and static) that are inside the fustrum and intersect with the projected ray. The static object collection is accelerated with the quadtree.
- Loop through all this gameobjects. If they have mesh we calculate all its triangles and for each of them we test collision against the raycast (in the local space of the gameobject). We do this until we've loop through all gameobjects.

_NOTE:_ Collected gameobjects are sorted by distance and we constantly check for minimum distance to avoid generating unnecessary triangles and speed up the process.

### Time managment & game mode

When the engine is in game mode, the scene is seen though the game camera (which has frustum culling). We also keep an internal game clock (aside from the app clock) that will only run when the game mode is activated. Its dt will be passed to all the updates instead of the real time dt from the app.

### Resource Management

In our resource system we have imitated the management of resources that Unity has. When starting the engine we generate specific resources (Mesh, material, bones ...) and in case a resource is duplicated we only send the information (Vertices of a mesh for example) to the gpu once. As in unity, we generate .meta files that link the original file (.png) with the own format file that we generate once it has been imported (.dds). In addition, our .meta files also store information on how to perform the import.

## **Skeletal animation subsystem**

The skeletal animation subsystem is composed by:
 * Animation Resource
 * Bone resource
 * Animation module
 * Animation component
 
Bones are treated as gameobject where the root is the hip. Doing this all the transformations will be applied correctly among parents and childrens. Bone transformations are stored inside a map that matches each bone with a structure that contains all the transformation data over time. The animation module contains a vector of animations that contains all the data needed, we just iterate all the bones and apply the right transformations over time.

The skinning process is done by duplicating the original mesh and deforming the duplicate one according to all the weights of the vertices influenced by the particular bone we're looking at in that moment inside the loop. Before deforming the mesh we always reset it back to the T pose so transformations don't add on top of each other and we do them always from the same starting point. The reset process also resets the vertices to 0 so the offset doesn't add up to itself on each loop. 

The animation module is in charge of managing the current setted animation; this means: deforming the mesh and interpolating the bones transformations that will affect the attached mesh. This module is controlled by a simple state machine that tells the current state of the animation.

* **Blending**: When we switch between animations, we perform a fixed time blending. To perform it, we interpolate between the position of the vertices of the previous animation with the animation that is replacing it. Both continue advancing according to the time of game.

![blending_gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25901477/50387245-16760480-06f8-11e9-8c2f-aa1be871503d.gif)

* **Interpolation**: 
Upon receiving the information that the _Assimp_ library gives us when importing an animation, we obtain all the keyframes necessary to animate the bones. However, we use interpolation methods such as _Lerp_(Position/Scale) and _SLerp_(Quaternion) to obtain an intermediate position between the current and the following _keyframe_. To be more precise we use the time to know if we are closer to one _keyframe_ or another.

## **Installation instructions**

Download the zip file and unzip it. Open the folder, execute the .exe and enjoy!

_IMPORTANT: do not modify, change or add any folder or file as you might not be able to execute the game._

***

## **Notes on performance**

There are three main known cases where the overall perfomance might decrease significantly:

* **Only the first time** you execute the engine the app will "freeze" as it's importing all the assets and generating its corresponding resources. The time will vary depending in the number and sizes of files that are being imported.
* If the z-buffer visualization is activated.
* When an animated model is loaded on scene **(especially if its playing its animation)** the engine perfomance might drop a lot. That's because the skinning process of deforming the mesh to match the bones positions of the corresponding skeleton needs to do a lot of matrix related operations multiple times per frame. As we don't use shaders in this engine all these operations are sended to the CPU (instead of the GPU) which is not prepared to handle matrix operations as well as the GPU does.
